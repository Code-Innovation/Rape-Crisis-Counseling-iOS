Advocacy ultimately encourages survivors to advocate for themselves, while giving them a voice when they are too weak to speak.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Sexual assault advocacy helps survivors to cope with the event of a sexual assault and addresses safety issues and risks that survivors face. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;In this training, we focus on sexual assault advocacy in a medical setting, as a survivor presents at a hospital emergency room or health center to receive treatment. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Crisis intervention focuses on helping the individual develop an action plan and connect to appropriate support. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;In your community, it is important to know which resources are available and appropriate for follow-up support.&lt;/p&gt;",

                                    "content": "&lt;p&gt;The core of advocacy is to listen and believe. The healing power of this is extraordinary. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Survivors do not need to prove that they are suffering to win support; advocates give unconditional support while safeguarding the individual&rsquo;s right to be treated with respect, whatever the circumstance. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The unfortunate reality is that an advocate may be the only person who believes a survivor without question, comment, or blame, which makes phrases, &ldquo;I believe you,&rdquo; and &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t your fault,&rdquo; that much more powerful. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The rare case when a survivor is dishonest is relatively unimportant. Clearly, the survivor is suffering on some level and has most likely been victimized in some way. In this instance, being deceived is a small price to pay for extending the healing power of unconditional belief that has helped so many survivors.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Another core piece of advocacy is to neither investigate nor judge.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Asking questions so that the account makes sense to you can jeopardize your relationship with the survivor. Leave the investigation to the investigators. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;This means no note-taking while the survivor talks about the assault. Keeping your hands free while the survivor is talking is an important way to use body language to communicate to the survivor that you&rsquo;re not &ldquo;taking&rdquo; anything (like taking notes or taking a report), but rather you are being present as a trusted ally.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Advocates are the only first responders who have no other responsibilities and no pressing agenda.&lt;/p&gt;",

We might think that if we do help, something bad might happen and we prefer to do nothing rather than doing the wrong thing. We might think that despite what we&rsquo;re seeing, we don&rsquo;t know the situation or what&rsquo;s going on. We may be afraid that the perpetrator will becoming violent towards us.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;We may say to ourselves, &ldquo;This looks bad. This shouldn&rsquo;t be happening. This is wrong.&rdquo; But it can be scary to step in and try to prevent a situation from getting worse. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;The more people who witness a situation, the less likely they are to get involved because each person thinks that it is someone else&rsquo;s responsibility. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;This is called the bystander effect&amp;nbsp;and it has been researched extensively. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;If you have ever taken a first-aid course, this is why the trainers tell you to point at someone and say &ldquo;Call the ambulance,&rdquo; and to tell other people specifically how they can help you. If we don&rsquo;t do that, others will stand there and assume that someone else will help, so they don&rsquo;t have to do anything.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Often, bystanders deny the physical intuition that tells us that something is wrong and that it will get worse if we don&rsquo;t do something. Our body has natural instincts to sense danger for a reason, and we need to pay attention to it not only when we&rsquo;re in danger but also to keep others safe.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;False beliefs about sexual violence are another reason people don&rsquo;t get involved, because the perpetrator or others may use these false beliefs to excuse their behavior. Although false beliefs about sexual assault attempt to blame the survivor for the crime, but it is always the perpetrator who is responsible for sexual violence.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;It is very unlikely that we will ever be faced with an opportunity to stop a rape in progress; this is not where we want to focus our attempts to intervene. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;We want to focus on the other end of the spectrum, on the occasions of verbal comments, unwanted contact and other high-frequency events.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;These are situations where for most of us, it&rsquo;s very easy to intervene because these situations often happen with people we know.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;By intervening in these contexts, we are helping to set social norms that say that sexual violence is not acceptable within our group.&lt;/p&gt;",

In these cases, it is best to get others involved as a group and let an authority know what is happening while we keep a safe distance.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;The most unsafe way to intervene is to get very close to the perpetrator and raise your voice to call attention to their behavior, as this could cause the perpetrator to focus their aggression on you. Whenever you consider intervening, it is essential to consider your safety first. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;It&rsquo;s important to think through the steps before you intervene. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;1. Notice the behavior: This is usually easy because when we see something happening, it catches our attention. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;2. Interpret it as a problem: Most of us know when something has the potential to turn into a problem.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;3. Assume responsibility: This is more difficult, because we can always find many reasons not to intervene, hoping that someone else will do it. Our default response is usually to try to distance ourselves from the situation. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;4. Chose how to intervene: Make a conscious choice about what the best way is to get involved. Can you involve others, so that you stay safe in the situation? What is the next step? There are many ways to intervene, including calling emergency services or notifying an authority.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;5. Attempt to help: It is important that we put whatever choice we have made about how to intervene into action. It is difficult to step outside yourself to help another person, especially if they are a stranger.&lt;/p&gt;",

In school, this could mean talking to a teacher, counselor or principal about what is happening so that they can step in and handle the situation. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Addressing the survivor can also be a way to intervene. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;For example, you could ask them if they are okay or if they need help. You could tell them that you are concerned about them, or that you think that they are too intoxicated to be able to consent, and offer to help them leave the immediate environment.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;If it seems safe, you can also address the potential perpetrator &ndash; but if you do this, there is a risk that they could create a problem with you by fighting or becoming violent. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;If we know the perpetrator, we can speak to their behavior in the moment. If they are intoxicated, get them away from the situation by creating a distraction or going to do something else, and then talking about their behavior later.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Intervention is whatever you can do in the moment to keep everybody safe. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;It can help to explore what you think safe behavior and consent look like, and what it looks like when behaviors cross the line into something that is done without another person&rsquo;s consent and that can become abusive.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Intervention can happen at many times and in many places.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;We need to be able to intervene when we see non-consensual behavior before it moves into the area of abusive behavior. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;If we intervene early, we can prevent the incident from becoming worse while setting social norms for how people should be acting.&lt;/p&gt;",

Some countries have laws that require confidentiality for service providers working with survivors of sexual assault and intimate partner violence.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Survivors experience events that can cause trauma. Sharing their personal information without their consent can cause additional trauma. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Sharing about sexual assault can also put the survivor&rsquo;s life at risk.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;For example, survivors have committed suicide out of shame when photos identifying them as a survivor of assault were posted by the media. In many contexts, being the survivor of sexual assault can expose the survivor to further risk of assault by members of the community, including law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;It takes immense courage to tell a stranger about highly personal and traumatic experiences. As a service provider, having a confidential relationship with the survivor can help them explore how they want to access the healthcare system and potentially report the crime to the police. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Having an advocate bound by confidentiality increases a survivor&rsquo;s ability to access healthcare and law enforcement services. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;In many cases, without confidentiality, the survivor would not feel comfortable coming forward.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Confidentiality is the foundation of good advocacy and service provision for survivors. In areas where there is only one advocate or a limited number of healthcare providers, confidentiality is the only way that survivors may feel able to access the services they need.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;For an advocate to be able to claim confidentiality, they must be trained. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;For this reason, it can be important to create formal trainings in your community that supplement this training primer.

If the survivor&rsquo;s information is not kept private, the perpetrator may be able to find the survivor and to perpetrate another crime against them.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Confidentiality refers to the rules that prohibit service providers from disclosing survivor information. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Many service providers, including advocates, are bound by the rules of confidentiality. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Often, local or national laws, regulations, donor or grant conditions, agency or organization policies or codes of ethics will include confidentiality rules. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;These rules:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;- Limit the disclosure of any information about the survivor by community-based service providers without the survivor&rsquo;s informed, written and time-limited consent.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Require that service providers disclose any limits to confidentiality during their initial meeting with the survivor.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Privilege is different from confidentiality. It applies to communications between the survivor and certain professions, as defined by law. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;These professions include physicians, psychologists and clinical social workers. In some countries and contexts, crisis counselors for sexual assault survivors and intimate partner violence survivors are included, but this is not always the case. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that communication is not considered privileged if it is overheard by a third party. If you work in an area where you are not covered by such a law, you must be very careful in your discussions with the survivor because if you are present when they are in a privileged conversation (for example, with a lawyer), then your presence as a third person could invalidate that privilege. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;There are exceptions to confidentiality.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;If you are advocating for a survivor of child or elder abuse, your country will likely have mandatory reporting laws that compel you to report the case to an authority.&lt;/p&gt;",

If they are unfit to give consent or are under the age where they can legally give consent, and there is no family member or guardian present to give consent, then the health center itself can give consent. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Try to give back a sense of trust and control.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Remember that over 85% of sexual assault perpetrators are known to the survivor (for example, a family member, acquaintance or friend), and the survivor&rsquo;s sense of trust and control has been violated.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Through your actions as an advocate, do your best to give the survivor a sense of trust in you and control over the situations around them. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;You can help to create a sense of control by asking permission before sitting down or taking other actions, for example asking if it is alright to ask the survivor questions. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Sexual assault survivors have had their consent violated and an important part of their recovery is to regain the power of their consent. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;At every opportunity, ask permission from the survivor. For example, a good way to begin is to approach the survivor while keeping a respectful physical distance and to ask, &ldquo;May I sit down?&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;If you do not already know the survivor and you have been called to serve as an advocate by the health center or other organization, introduce yourself to the advocate. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;In your own words, cover these essential roles of an advocate:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;* A volunteer&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;* Bound by confidentiality&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;* Present to advocate for survivors&rsquo; needs at the health center and for no other reason&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;If the survivor has pain, bleeding, nausea, difficulty breathing, or if they feel unsafe in the health center, notify a healthcare provider immediately.&lt;/p&gt;",

                                                    "content": "&lt;p&gt;Advocates must have excellent listening skills, as listening is far more effective than talking for building trust and finding out what the survivor needs. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;For an advocate, the skill of active listening is essential if you are to successfully connect with and support the survivor. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;We often think of listening as passive, but when we listen we construct meaning from both verbal and nonverbal&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#cmnt3&quot; id=&quot;cmnt_ref3&quot;&gt;[c]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;messages. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Active listening requires that you fully concentrate, understand, respond and remember what the survivor is saying.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;You must also communicate to the survivor that you are listening, so that they feel heard. Providing appropriate feedback can help the survivor to feel more at ease communicating with you. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;You can do this verbally and non-verbally the following ways. However, please keep in mind that active listening is done differently across different cultures, so not suggestions&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#cmnt4&quot; id=&quot;cmnt_ref4&quot;&gt;[d]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;may be appropriate for your context:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;* Nod your head: When the survivor is speaking, this can be a powerful way to affirm that they are being listened to and understood.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;* Be aware of your posture: An active listener conveys that they are listening through their body language and usually tends to lean slightly forward or to the side when sitting. Active listeners tend to have their head at a slight angle or rest their head on one hand.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;* Pay attention with your body language: Do your best not to fidget, play with your hair or fingernails, look at your watch or a clock, or do any other action that could be interpreted by the survivor as inattentive. It helps to create self-awareness around what you do when you are distracted. Learn to control these non-verbal cues to increase your focus, attention and ability to be present.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;* Verbal active listening: You could say &ldquo;Mmm hmm&rdquo; at certain points when the survivor is speaking, to show that you are listening and encourage them to continue. However, gauge the reaction of the survivor to this technique, as it can feel like interrupting if overused or used in the wrong context.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;* Remember the details: You will get distracted, especially by things happening in the health center environment, but it is essential that you do your best to remember important details that the survivor shares. This will build trust and show the survivor that you are listening.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;* Use eye contact sparingly: While it can be encouraging for the listener to look at the speaker, it can also be intimidating, so use this technique carefully. Use your own best judgement to determine how much eye contact is appropriate for the situation and when. When you do use eye contact, combine it with other non-verbal techniques to encourage the survivor to speak.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Active listening also involves patience during natural pauses and periods of silence. You may be tempted to jump in with questions or comments when these occur, but do not. Instead, give the survivor the time and space they need to explore their thoughts and feelings.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Before you decide to speak, think of the acronym WAIT: Why Am I Talking? &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Most of the time, you should be listening. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;In general, it is best not to repeat back, or paraphrase, the survivor&rsquo;s words. Although some words of encouragement may be beneficial, paraphrasing tends to take the focus away from what the survivor is saying, as they may be tempted to correct or further clarify their message for you.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Adjust your active listening by paying close attention to the survivor&rsquo;s verbal and body language cues, to see if you need to decrease or increase your level of feedback.&lt;/p&gt;",

Acceptance is the foundation of empathy and happens when the advocate acknowledges the survivor&rsquo;s feelings, situation and perspectives without any judgement, criticism or blame. Acceptance doesn&rsquo;t mean agreement or approval, it simply means that you acknowledge what the survivor is sharing, especially when they are feeling strong emotions. Avoid summarizing what the survivor is sharing, and instead simply acknowledge the emotions they are feeling.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Never tell a survivor that you understand how they feel &ndash; you do not. Every survivor is different.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;- Asking questions: Use your best judgement when asking questions, as questions should be only in service to the survivor and never to indulge your own sense of curiosity. Keep questions open-ended (so that they cannot be answered with a yes or no answer), as this encourages the survivor to speak rather than feeling interrogated. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;- Paraphrasing: Reflecting back to the survivor what they have said can show them that you are paying attention and that you are staying present with them. Use your best judgement for paraphrasing may be appropriate. When you are finished, ask the survivor if you understood them correctly and give them a chance to clarify.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;- Affirming the survivor&rsquo;s experience: Affirmations such as &ldquo;You are strong,&rdquo; and &ldquo;You will get through this,&rdquo; recognize a survivor&rsquo;s strengths and can help build their confidence in their own resilience. However, you need to fully mean your affirmation and express it in a way that is appropriate to the survivor and their situation, or you risk alienating them and making them feel further isolated and alone.&lt;/p&gt;",

If you are passive in attempting to obtain those services, you will not get what you want to meet the survivors&rsquo; needs. However, if you are aggressive, you may anger those who have the resources the survivor needs. When advocating for a survivor&rsquo;s needs, assertiveness is the best option.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Your cultural context will determine how each of these traits are expressed in your community and in the health center. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Building Assertiveness&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;As an advocate, sometimes you may have difficulty obtaining services for a survivor or persuading someone to help. If you learn to be assertive, you can often get what you want and still maintain good relationships. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;- Be prepared: Make sure you know what you want to say, why you want to say it, and how you want to say it. You may run into potential obstacles or resistance, so think in advance about how you might handle any challenges that may arise. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;- Body language: If you are speaking to someone in person, stand or sit straight but relaxed. Even when speaking on the phone, this posture can help you feel more confident. Face the person you are speaking to with a pleasant but serious facial expression. Keep your voice calm and soft and your eyes focused on the other person. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;- Use &ldquo;I&rdquo; statements:&amp;nbsp;&ldquo;I&rdquo; statements are direct and not accusatory, like &ldquo;you&rdquo; statements can be. Keep the focus on the challenge you are facing, rather than on the other person. For example, try &ldquo;I would like to be able to tell you what the survivor needs,&rdquo; instead of, &ldquo;You are not listening to what I am saying.&rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;- Know the facts and use them to support your case. Avoid judgments or accusations. The person you are speaking with can argue with judgments and accusations, but they cannot argue with facts. For example, say, &ldquo;An hour ago, you told me the survivor would be eligible for free antiretroviral medication,&rdquo; instead of, &ldquo;Why did you tell me the survivor was eligible for free antiretroviral medication when you know that was not the case?&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;- Focus on the survivor&rsquo;s needs: Make sure that you focus on the solution and what the survivor needs. This will help you earn the trust of the other person. Be calm and open, not angry, aggressive, or abrasive. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;- Speak with confidence:&amp;nbsp;In communicating your message, speak clearly, firmly, and loud enough to be easily heard. Use fewer words for more effect, and don&rsquo;t apologize or make excuses for your position. Support yourself and what you are seeking to accomplish. Project confidence in your role as an advocate.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;- Listen:&amp;nbsp;Listen carefully to what the other person is saying to you. Listening carefully will be critical in preparing your response. Answer questions and clarify information when asked. Make clear, direct requests. Do not invite the person to say &ldquo;no.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;- Do not back down:&amp;nbsp;Stand firm for the survivor&rsquo;s needs. Negotiate a compromise rather than give in completely. Remember, stick to your goal, and do not allow yourself to become distracted by other issues.&lt;/p&gt;",

The survivor does not need to please anyone but themselves. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Creating and maintaining personal boundaries support&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#cmnt6&quot; id=&quot;cmnt_ref6&quot;&gt;[f]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;the survivor as they develop trust and vulnerability in their relationship with the advocate. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;As advocates, we need to be aware of warning signs that a survivor is crossing a boundary into what could be an unhealthy relationship with us. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;We must avoid putting ourselves in potentially risky situations or creating potentially unsafe or risky situations for the survivor. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;For this reason, it is important to independently address our own personal issues and not bring them into our advocacy for survivors. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Advocates often have a personal history as survivors of sexual assault, intimate partner violence or another trauma in their past. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;While this can be part of why you want to volunteer, it is important that you create and maintain strong boundaries so that you do not over-identify with the survivor.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;There will be times when a survivor&rsquo;s story may trigger your own trauma to come to the surface. If this happens, it is important that you are aware of how to create and maintain strong personal boundaries. Otherwise, you could end up relating to the survivor around your own trauma, rather than your role to help and support the survivor with their needs.&lt;/p&gt;",

You may think in the moment that you are the only person who can help the survivor, and that you could support them better if they could contact you directly, rather than contacting your network of advocates or your organization, but this is simply not true.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Another example of crossing boundaries would be to plan to see the survivor outside of your position as a crisis advocate. It is essential to keep your relationship as an advocate clear and you cannot do this if you try to create another type of relationship with the survivor. For this reason, it is important to refer the survivor to other service providers in your network and to guard that the relationship does not overstep these boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;",

I know because I have been in difficult situations.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Remember, you are not a therapist or a counselor; your role is to listen to and support the survivor through a crisis situation, not to help them with decades of problems and issues. &nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;The survivor may attach to you, so you to need to draw boundaries. For example, if they insist that you are on the only person who understands their situation, you may need to remind them that there are many qualified service providers who can help and support them.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;After supporting a survivor, it is normal to think back and wonder if you helped them to the best of your ability. You may want to follow up with them, but do not reach out. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Allow them to make the decision about whether to reach out.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Especially if the case has been difficult, it can be helpful to talk things over with your organization, other advocates or a counselor without breaking confidentiality. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;If you feel overwhelmed by supporting a survivor, it is even more important to seek help. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Giving yourself professional psychological support for your work will help you to continue volunteering. Recognize your own limits, your stress levels and how you are trigged&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#cmnt9&quot; id=&quot;cmnt_ref9&quot;&gt;[i]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. If an unresolved issue from your own experiences surfaces, professional psychological support enables you to address it in a healthy and appropriate way. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Remember why you wanted to be an advocate in the first place and make a commitment to taking care of yourself so your work thrives.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;You should only volunteer when you are able to maintain strong personal boundaries. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;A stressful life situation can make volunteering difficult. When this is the case, it is always acceptable to take a break. The &ldquo;Self-Care and Resiliency&rdquo; section has more information about how to care for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;",

It may be necessary to communicate by phone or electronically, which could include text messaging or email. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;It is extremely important to be sure that that the communication is safe, especially when communicating with survivors of intimate partner violence. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Always ask the survivor, when they are not accompanied by the perpetrator, how to communicate with them safely and follow their lead.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Arranging to Meet at the Health Center: As an advocate, a survivor may contact you by phone or electronically asking you to meet them at the health center. For the purposes of evidence collection, is important that you tell them not to use the toilet, eat or drink until they have been seen by a healthcare provider at the health center. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;You may plan to meet them personally or to have someone from your network of advocates meet them, depending on the situation. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Communicating by Phone: Phone communication or video messaging involves the same advocacy skills as face-to-face communication, with the following additional suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;- Be sure that you have adequate phone credit and a strong phone signal, so you do not get disconnected.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Find someplace quiet to talk from and try to keep background noise to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Before you begin, ask if the time of the call is convenient for the survivor and make other arrangements if needed.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Match your tone of voice to what you are communicating. For example, if you are expressing empathy, keep your voice soft and speak slowly. Tone of voice is especially important because you do not have the benefit of visual cues to reinforce your message.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Take notes on your main points before the call, so that you do not forget critical information you need to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Reassure survivors that you are listening by using phrases such as &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; so that they know you are giving them your full attention. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Use the same professionalism you would in an in-person encounter. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Communicating Electronically&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;It might be necessary to communicate with a survivor online, to exchange information clearly or to arrange to accompany them to seek medical care.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;It is much easier for a survivor to misinterpret a message received by text or email than it would be face-to-face, because there are no non-verbal signals to help convey meaning.&lt;/p&gt;",

Ask the survivor how you can best serve them. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Try to help them feel comfortable in starting the process of talking because it may be very difficult. Just because they contacted you doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re ready to share, so you need to create a sense of safety for them. Let the survivor know you are listening and that you are there.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The first concern is always the physical safety of the caller. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If there are disturbing background noises or the person is in a physical state of alarm, address their physical safety first before you asses&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#cmnt10&quot; id=&quot;cmnt_ref10&quot;&gt;[j]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;whatever else is going on, until it&rsquo;s clear that the caller is not in physical danger or in need of emergency aid. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Background noise like television or children may also indicate that there is a lot happening around the person and that may impact their ability to talk about difficult issues, as well as your ability to understand what the caller is saying. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;It is important that the caller feels safe. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If they sound anxious or upset, and they start talking about what has happened, it may make them more nervous or they may start to cry. Their tone of voice may rise or they may speak faster. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;You may need to help calm them down and perhaps tell them to pause for a minute, and not worry yet about telling you what&rsquo;s happened. You might suggest they take some deep breaths with you, to help calm you both and to relax. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If they need a moment to gather themselves, that is okay. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If the person starts to whisper or hangs up on you, it may mean they no longer have privacy. You do not want them to feel like because they called, now you are going to force them to talk about something that may not be appropriate right now. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Confidentiality helps to create a sense of trust and safety for the caller, so we want to ensure that confidentiality is respected.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;This means that if the survivor tells you something, you need to keep it confidential. Mandated reporting means that you must report it to an authority, depending on the laws in your area, and it mostly relates to suicidal tendencies or child abuse.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Because you are only hearing verbal cues, practicing active listening becomes even more important to show that you&rsquo;re paying attention. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If you notice yourself getting distracted during the call, sit up or move locations so that you can focus completely on what the caller is saying. Holding a listening posture, even though the caller cannot see you, will help with this. So will giving verbal cues, like saying &ldquo;I hear you,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I see.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Pay attention to what is not being said and to the tone of voice of the caller. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;We need to listen for what&rsquo;s really going on and be open to subtle cues. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;It is also helpful to validate the caller&rsquo;s feelings and to assure them that calling was a good idea. Listening in this way helps the caller to identify emotions and encourage them to talk about something they may not have shared before. In addition, help the caller to feel like they are in control of the call. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Remember that the conversation is about helping the caller, not you. You may experience strong emotion during the call and while that is okay, it is not appropriate for you to communicate them in any way to the caller. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Avoid making judgements about the caller, who may be doing things that you do not understand. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The call is about them and getting them the help and support that they need.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Often, callers&rsquo; stories will be difficult to understand, especially around the sequence of events. The caller may also try to give you excessive detail to try to help you understand what happened. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Let the caller tell their story without jumping to conclusions and accompany them on their journey through this process. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If the caller tells you something you find hard to believe, because that is not your experience of the world, remember that everyone is different and validate their experience. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;It can be frustrating to feel like the caller is rambling or telling a very long story, but do not lose focus as you never know when the caller will share something of key importance.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;While we want to support the caller and offer referrals and help, we do not want to get so caught up in sharing information that we lose our connection with the caller. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Avoid thinking you can fix the situation, that you know more than the caller does, or that you have all the answers, all of which can make the caller feel inferior and wonder why they called.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Fear can impact our ability to listen, because we are afraid of saying the wrong thing. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If you have these fears, it is important to talk to someone about them and to make sure that offering this kind of support is something that you really want to do. Then, it is important to put these feelings aside and to be completely present for the caller.&lt;/p&gt;",

They may start to use the helpline as an opportunity to unload, and you will need to use your communication skills to help identify what it is they need at that moment. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;You will need good communication skills to clarify that you have correctly understood what the caller is saying and that you have their story correct.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Paraphrasing: Repeating the caller&rsquo;s message is a key communication skill and involves repeating what the caller said in similar, but fewer, words. Do this anytime a caller tells you a long story, to get to the root of what is going on and to test your current understanding of the content so far. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If your paraphrasing is correct, it encourages the caller to continue because they know that they have been heard and understood, which creates trust and rapport. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Clarifying:&amp;nbsp;This is another important communication skill to use, because you will not always understand the message the caller is trying to convey, especially if their timeline jumps around a lot. It is always better to ask a clarifying question than to assume you understand something. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Otherwise, when you paraphrase what you thought you heard, the caller may become upset because you did not hear them correctly, which breaks trust and rapport and does not give them what they need. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Clarifying gives the caller control as they have an opportunity to agree or to correct your understanding of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Reflecting:&amp;nbsp;Reflecting back to the person what you are hearing can be useful to help identify feelings. Rather than asking questions, we can reflect feelings back as the caller is talking about something that happened. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;For example, we might say, &ldquo;I might feel angry if that happened to me,&rdquo; to start to name feelings for somebody, especially if they are feeling numb and disconnected from their feelings. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Reflecting lets the caller know that you are listening and empathizing with their feelings. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Pick and choose how you ask questions: It is not necessary for you to know every piece of information; be sure not to ask questions just to satisfy your curiosity. Avoid asking &ldquo;why&rdquo; questions, because they tend to be accusatory. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Rather than blaming the survivor, blame the perpetrator who violated boundaries and committed the sexual assault. Asking questions like &ldquo;Can you tell me more about how that made you feel?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What do you think that means?&rdquo; can help lead a quiet caller into a conversation. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Remember, this is a difficult topic for people to discuss and they may feel wary and uncomfortable about what they are saying, so we want to make them feel more comfortable. For example, &ldquo;I would be angry,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;It is understandable that you feel angry. Many people would feel angry in that situation.&rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Questions can also help if the caller starts to lose focus on what they were saying. Picking a single theme and selecting one word or phrase to repeat back as a question can be helpful to bring them back to what is happening now and why they called. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The easiest way to do this is to ask, &ldquo;What made you call the helpline today?&rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The helpline is there to support people dealing with sexual assault, not to help them deal with decades of issues in a 20-minute helpline call. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;It is important to focus the caller because sometimes receiving help and support can feel like counseling, and the helpline is not counseling. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Our role as an advocate is to find the one thing that we can talk about to handle the crisis in the moment, and to hopefully refer the caller to someone who can provide longer-term support, if that is available in your community.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Once we have heard what the caller says and we have helped them to figure out some of their feelings, we have a better understanding of why the person has called and what they need. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Although the caller may feel helpless and hopeless, it is important to help them realize that they have the solutions that they need. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;They are in control because this is their issue and you cannot fix it for them. You are there to support, provide resources if necessary, and empower them to find a solution.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;You may have callers who do not want to end the call because they need more help and support than the helpline can offer. They may be scared and afraid of trying solutions on their own, but in realize they&rsquo;re the only ones who can take control of the situation. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Once they chose a solution that works best for them, you may need to restate the problem and summarize the different solutions. For example, you could say, &ldquo;We have talked about what is going on and how you feel, and we have come up with several plans. Here are the things you have agreed to try.&rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;We want to make sure that the caller creates a Safety Plan (more about this in the section &ldquo;How to Safety Plan&rdquo;), because once the call ends, that plan is going to help them know what to do next. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Asking, for example, &ldquo;How do things look to you now?&rdquo; is one way to see if things look more hopeful and safer than they did at the beginning of the call. This does not mean that everything is fixed, but it does help the caller reflect that together you have created a plan to deal with what is going on right now, so that when the call ends they can take control of the situation. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If you have someone who remains unwilling to get off the call, you can say &ldquo;Now I am going to let you go. You can try the things we planned and if you are having a difficult time, you can always call us back.

If the caller is harassing you on the helpline, tell the person that their number can be traced and hang up. One way to bypass this is to play an automated message as an initial helpline greeting, if that is possible with your phone line. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Many callers will also feel scared the first time they call, and although they may have thought they were ready to talk, they may hang up the phone. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Remember that they are having a tough time, that this is not about you, and do not take it personally. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If the person is not speaking on the other line, you may hear they are crying and it may take them a minute to speak, or they may never talk. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;In these situations, you need to keep saying things to help achieve contact. Give them the benefit of the doubt and ask if you can help them. Especially if someone is crying, say something to calm them, for example, &ldquo;I am going to take a couple of deep breaths to help calm myself, if you would like to join me.&rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;They may start talking or they may not feel comfortable enough to talk. If after that, they decide not to communicate, you cannot be helpful to them and you need to keep the line open for someone else who may be trying to call in. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;After you&rsquo;ve tried to establish trust and safety, you may need to say, for example, &ldquo;We are always here to talk, so when you are ready, I would be happy to have you call back. Right now I have to let you go, though. Thank you for calling.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you may get a phone call from somebody calling the helpline who is angry that a family member has received advocacy services and who screams into the phone, maybe using aggressive language. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Try not to let them know that you are upset, as that is what are hoping to do: do not give them the satisfaction. Keep your voice disinterested, take a deep breath and remember, it is not about you. They are just targeting their anger about what is going on at you, because you are available. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;You could say, for example, &ldquo;I am sorry you feel that way, but I cannot talk to you while you are screaming. I am hanging up now,&rdquo; and then end the call. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;You do not have to keep them on the phone hoping their attitude will change; that is not what the helpline is for.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If you suspect that a caller has mental health issues, or if the caller&rsquo;s focus suddenly changes to you, for example asking about sexual or personal details, and you are sure that the person is not a survivor, consider ending the call. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Taking inappropriate phone calls is not the job of helpline volunteers. You are there to help people in need who are in a crisis around sexual assault. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If you have a resistant or chronic caller several times in the same evening, make sure to note the number they are calling from and if they have already received services from your helpline.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Stay focused on small steps and problem resolution by focusing the caller on what made them call right now, and addressing that one problem or one issue that they are having, rather them allowing them to ramble. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;It is okay to end the call firmly but gently. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Be firm about summarizing what you&rsquo;ve discussed, how they are feeling and then safety plan moving forward with them so that they can act to solve things on their own. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Whenever you end a call, no matter how frustrated, upset or angry you might be with the caller, you must do so politely and respectfully. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;You may have a lot of feelings when you get off the phone, and these are normal reactions to have, but it is important to not react from your feelings when you are on the phone with the caller. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;It is not about your feelings, it is about listening to help the caller figure out what the plan is moving forward, and giving them the support and validation that they need.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If you need to talk to someone about your feelings regarding a call, that is okay, but you must not do that with the caller themselves. We always want to make sure that we are being polite, respectful, helpful and supportive to everybody that calls the helpline.&lt;/p&gt;",

Culture influences values, actions and self-expectations, and impacts perceptions and expectations of others.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Many of us identify with more than one cultural group. For example, some people may place more emphasis on their ancestry while other may place more emphasis on their sexual orientation or gender role. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Even within the same culture, some characteristics will be more important to one person than to another, and the differences between two individuals may be more pronounced than their similarities.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Diversity is defined as differences to culture, background and experience among individuals and groups. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Inclusion is defined as the programs and strategies that embrace each person&rsquo;s diversity. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Both diversity and inclusion occur in a safe, positive and nurturing environment &mdash; going beyond simply tolerating difference, and towards celebrating it. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Barriers to diversity and inclusion can be caused by &ldquo;cultural collisions.&rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;This is when groups with different cultural characteristics (for example, traditions, values, world views or languages) come together and neither group can view the situation from the perspective of the other.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;So that you can help to avoid &ldquo;cultural collisions,&rdquo; it is important to understand how cultural factors influence survivors&rsquo; interactions with you and the services providers at the health center.&lt;/p&gt;",

Learning about greetings, conversational style and nonverbal communication will help you to support survivors much more effectively. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Here are some tips:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;1. Learn to recognize cues: Be adaptable to the survivor&rsquo;s behavior. Observe the survivor and how they are behaving, then try to mirror their behavior. For example, if the survivor is leaning forward, you could learn forward too. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;2. Accommodate the differences: What is considered normal in one culture may be insulting in another. Remain aware of how the survivor is reacting to you and remain patient and accommodating. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;3. Never assume: Never assume that because the survivor is from a certain culture, they will behave a certain way. Values and beliefs are personal. Be aware of your own interpretations of other&rsquo;s nonverbal behavior, and realize that mistaken assumptions lead to misinterpretations and miscommunication. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;4. If in doubt, ask: There is no better tool for effective communication, regardless of culture, than asking. If you do or say something that seems to strike the survivor as inappropriate or offensive, simply ask if you have done anything wrong and what you can do to remedy the situation.&lt;/p&gt;",

The perpetrator plans the process in advance and while they may not consider their actions sexual assault, they have thought through the assault and decided that they will do whatever it takes to have sex with the survivor. When they decide that, they cross the line into criminal behavior.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;2. The perpetrator involves alcohol and drugs: Alcohol and drugs incapacitate people and make them easier to isolate. By separating the survivor from their friends and support network, the perpetrator puts themselves in a power and control in that situation.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;3. Perpetrators need to isolate the survivor: This physical and social isolation creates a situation where the perpetrator can manipulate what is happening and take away the survivor&rsquo;s power.&lt;/p&gt;",

Because it is acceptable to do this, we are more willing to accept alcohol and trust that the person and the situation are okay. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Societal factors make it easier for a perpetrator to use alcohol to manipulate and coerce a situation to their benefit and to have power over the survivor.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;In certain contexts, there can be strong peer pressure to drink and become intoxicated. This is especially true among young people and people in university or campus environments.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;It is socially acceptable in many places to drink until you become intoxicated. For example, there are many jokes about what drunk people do, games to get drunk, and different methods to make people drink faster.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Many people do not see alcohol as a drug or believe that it is dangerous. Because it is widely advertised, people think that it cannot be so bad.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Many people who drink alcohol do not actually know how much a serving of alcohol is or looks like. One serving of hard liquor fits in a shot glass. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;This is important to measure because we often see drinks being served that are much larger or are served drinks that have an unknown quantity of alcohol. Added sugar also masks the taste of alcohol, making it difficult to determine how many servings are in one drink.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;For example, someone has been given a large glass of an unknown alcoholic drink and they drink it all. They think that one glass equals one serving, but in fact the drink could have multiple servings. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;If this is more than someone planned to drink that night, then they may quickly become intoxicated and not be fully aware of it. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Once they are intoxicated, a perpetrator can quickly isolate a survivor, for example by pretending to be taking care of them and leaving with the survivor for another location.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;People who are overly intoxicated are not able to give consent. This is the type of manipulation that leads to drug-facilitated sexual assault.&lt;/p&gt;",

They may see that the survivor doing something that they would not do while sober.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;If friends are not educated about sexual assault, they may not be able to recognize the warning signs of the situation. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;For example, friends may see the survivor leaving with someone they find unusual. They may find the situation funny or not see any reason to be concerned.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Another example of some consensual behavior that may occur in the context of drug-facilitated sexual assault is sexual activity at any level. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;The survivor may be unable to participate because of their intoxication level or they may vomit. Someone who is intoxicated at this level is unable to give consent.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;After the event or in the morning, the survivor may be confused about how the event ended. They may remember being so intoxicated that they were unable to participate in sexual activity. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Perhaps they had expected the event to be romantic but after some time has passed, the survivor sees the event much differently. They not remember large pieces of the event and they may feel regrets.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;There is no legal limit that makes someone too intoxicated to give consent to sexual activity. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;To determine if someone could give consent, we need to look at each individual situation and see what occurred in this context.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;With drug-facilitated sexual assault, we identify a cycle where the perpetrator manipulates the situation to their advantage to have power and control. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Perpetrators use isolation to get someone alone and away from their support network, so they can manipulate and take advantage of them. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;They often manipulate what is socially acceptable to make their behavior seem normal, for example offering to buy alcoholic drinks or pressuring someone to go someplace private where they can be alone.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;For example, the perpetrator can often self-present as a kind and caring person or even a hero by offering to walk someone home or take care of them at a party. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;The issue is that the assault is premeditated and that the survivor is targeted by the perpetrator.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Often, perpetrators of sexual assault have a sense of entitlement that they can have sex with whoever they want. They may also have violent or sexual trauma in their background and a lack of self-control. Perpetrators often distort reality and tell themselves that the survivor was inviting their attention and the assault.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;After the assault, the perpetrator will likely use justification to deny that what happened was sexual assault. They may allude to false beliefs about sexual assault to try to blame the survivor.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;The responsibility for sexual assault always rests with the perpetrator.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;No matter what risky behavior a survivor participates in, it is always the perpetrator who decides to commit sexual assault.&lt;/p&gt;",

It is often crushed into powder so it can be easily sprinkled onto food or added to liquids, where it dissolves very quickly. Rohypnol is odorless, colorless and tasteless in powder form and it takes about 30 minutes to notice its effects. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Because of its use in drug-facilitated sexual assault, pharmaceutical companies tried to make Rohypnol turn blue when added to liquids, but they did not succeed and the drug remains almost impossible to detect.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;- Gamma-Hydroxybutyric (GHB): This clear or light-colored liquid can also come in powder form. It can be produced in a lab and is made with common commercially-available chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;- Ketamine: A legal anesthetic, ketamine is an effective pain treatment that can cause amnesia. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;- Ecstasy: Manufactured in labs, ecstasy has many names. If someone is on ecstasy their inhibitions are lowered and they experience a sense of euphoria; it can appear that they are giving consent but if they are under the influence of a drug, they cannot consent.&lt;/p&gt;",

A significant number of perpetrators are youth themselves. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Most adolescent survivors do not tell their parents or other adults about the assault, but they may tell a friend so that they can get support without having to involve the police or their parents.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;By the age of 18, 1 in 4 women and 1 in 6 men will experience sexual assault. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Girls and boys who are sexually abused as children carry that trauma with them into adulthood and the impact of this on their mental, emotional and physical health can be significant.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;For adolescent survivors who were sexually assaulted by a family member or caretaker, you may be mandated to notify the appropriate authorities.&lt;/p&gt;",

Survivors are often confined so that they cannot leave, and denied food, water and medical care. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Survivors of human trafficking may be particularly vulnerable because many have previously experienced violence or abuse, or may not have a way to meet their own basic needs. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Sex trafficking of minors within their own countries is also an issue.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Adolescents who run away from home are at dangerous risk of become sex trafficked minors because recruiters usually make contact with adolescent runaways within 48 hours of them leaving home and becoming homeless.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;We often have stereotypes of what trafficked people look like that are inaccurate and that keep us from correctly identifying survivors in our neighborhoods and communities.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;These can include, but are not limited to, the false beliefs that trafficked people must be injured, dirty, drug-addicted or from another country.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;As an advocate, asking the right questions can help determine if somebody is a victim of human trafficking. We want to be sure to create a safe environment for that person to disclose, if they chose to. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;If you suspect that a survivor is being trafficked, you can shift your questions towards whether the survivor was being paid to participate in the sexual assault.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Some questions to determine if a survivor is being trafficked can include:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;- Did anyone take photos of you? If so, what did they use them for? &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Did anyone ever force you to engage in sex through online websites, informal arrangements or escort services?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Are you required to meet a certain amount of money or nightly quota by engaging in sex? If you do not meet the quota, are there consequences?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Are you threatened with violence or being deprived of water or food?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Are you locked up, shut in your room, or not allowed to communicate with family and friends?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Are you afraid that someone might harm your family?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Much like intimate partner violence, survivors of sex trafficking face a significant fear of sexual and physical abuse if they try to leave. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Like intimate partner violence, perpetrators use brainwashing techniques to convince the survivor that they will not be able to survive without them &mdash; especially if the survivor is afraid that she will be prosecuted for commercial sex work without the protection of her trafficker. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Adolescents often run away because there is not a safe situation at home, and if they are trafficked, the situation is much worse. They may fear that changing their situation again risks making things even worse. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Especially if the trafficker is holding the survivor&rsquo;s identity documents, leaving may feel unsafe and almost impossible.&lt;/p&gt;",

Your role is to be supportive and helpful. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;You may have very strong feelings, which is normal. While you may need to speak with someone about them afterwards, in the moment it is essential not to take the focus away from the survivor and their story. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Trauma:&amp;nbsp;Sexual assault is often a highly traumatic experience, so it is important for advocates to understand what trauma is and how trauma impacts survivors. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Trauma is an experience that overwhelms our capacity to have a sense of control over ourselves and our immediate environment. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;During sexual assault, the survivor does not have control over their own body and this is naturally both upsetting and uncomfortable. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Trauma overwhelms our ability to maintain connection with others and after sexual assault, when our sense of trust has been violated, it can be extremely difficult to trust and reach out to someone. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;While you might think that anyone who has been sexually assaulted would want to come forward, in fact the violation of trust that the survivor has experienced make the very act of disclosing unsafe. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Because of trauma, it can feel safer not to trust people and for the survivor to withdraw into themselves. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Self-blame: Trauma overwhelms our ability to make meaning of our experience. Survivors never get to ask the perpetrators, &ldquo;Why did you do this to me?&rdquo; All the same, these questions take time to go away. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Often, the survivor turns their questions inwards and their experience of sexual assault becomes self-blame. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;They may think that they were sexually assaulted because they did something wrong, for example going to the wrong place, speaking to the wrong person, or making a wrong decision, but this is not the case. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Self-blame becomes a barrier to disclosure because the survivor may fear that they will not be believed, or that they will be blamed for the sexual assault that happened to them.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If the survivor is experiencing self-blame, focus on what the perpetrator did to violate boundaries and commit a crime. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;It is always appropriate to emphasize that the survivor did nothing wrong and that the sexual assault is not their fault.&lt;/p&gt;",

Perhaps they want to community to know what has happened or to go through the legal justice process.&lt;/p&gt;",

The survivor may insist that they do not want the perpetrator to get into trouble, they only want the abuse to stop. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The survivor may feel intense guilt and self-blame around the fact that by disclosing, the survivor may get the perpetrator into trouble, even though it is the perpetrator who did something wrong. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Because of the consequences, there are often far more reasons to stay silent than there are to disclose. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;When a survivor does disclose, we want to validate the person and recognize how much courage and strength it takes to come forward. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;We want to recognize and honor the barriers they had to face and the consequences of their choice to speak up and get support.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;When you respond to disclosure, are some things you can reflect to the survivor: &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- How brave they are to be honest about what happened.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- How strong they are for coming forward&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- That you believe them.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- That you are sorry that this happened to them.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- That the feelings they are experiencing are normal.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- That the assault was not their fault.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- That they did what they needed to stay safe.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- That you cannot make promises about what will happen in the future. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;For example, as an advocate, you cannot guarantee that the survivor will not have to speak to the police, or that the sexual assault will stay a secret from their family.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- That what happens next is up to the survivor and it is their choice to make.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Every survivor processes sexual assault differently and as an advocate, you will be faced with many different situations. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;For example, a survivor may tell their story and break down in tears, while another may be extremely angry and tense. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Others may show no apparent emotion, or laugh nervously when disclosing, which may tempt you or others to dismiss their story. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;A survivor&#39;s reaction may be an indication that they are not able to handle or cope with the intense feelings that are coming up.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Remember that all survivors cope differently and all responses are valid. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Be aware that you might have strong feelings triggered by a survivor&#39;s disclosure, whether from what they are sharing or the way they are sharing it. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;It is important to keep the focus on the survivor and validate their feelings, and to stay in their experience in your role as an advocate. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;After your time with the survivor is complete, you will need to take time for your own processing (see the section, Self-Care for Advocates). &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;It may take practice to affirm and support the survivor, especially when you feel triggered. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Saying the wrong thing or saying something in the wrong way can shut down the process of disclosure for someone. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;It can be helpful to role play with other advocates so that you are more comfortable in the moment, knowing what to say.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, we do not want to put too much focus on survivor&#39;s feelings as they are disclosing, because we want to give them the time and space for a variety of feelings and they need to feel safe. This safety includes physical protection from the perpetrator, but also a sense of security from having you as an advocate beside them.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Ask the survivor what they need, to help give them a sense of security and control over their environment. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;It could be water, a blanket, food, or something else that makes them feel more comfortable. Often the health center will have these things available and a healthcare provider will be able to get the for the survivor. Try to stay next to the survivor as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;You are doing your job as an advocate when you listen to and believe the survivor, and try to be helpful and supportive.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;You do not need to be, or act like, an expert. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;It can often feel like you are not doing enough, but the ability for you to offer unconditional support to the survivor can be a crucial step in their path to healing. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;While you may sometimes feel overwhelmed in your role as an advocate, you do not need to have all the answers to help a survivor get the support they need.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Often there is additional shame and silence around disclosing sexual assault related to intimate partner violence.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;In cases of intimate partner violence, it can be helpful to repeat to the survivor that just because they consented to be in a previous situation does not mean that they automatically consent to all future situations.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Consent must be given every time.&lt;/p&gt;",

It is important to be patient and supportive.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The most important thing a survivor needs during disclosure is to be believed. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;It is not about you fixing the survivor&rsquo;s problems in the moment, or trying to determine if something was illegal or what to do next. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Your job is simply to listen and support the survivor, and to recognize that they have survived something horrible and lived to share about it. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Reaffirm that what they did was the right thing to do, because they are still alive to talk about what happened: they are a survivor.&lt;/p&gt;",

Focus on interests, not positions: Interests are the needs and goals that you would like to achieve on behalf of the survivor. Positions are the sides you take during a negotiation. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Be careful not to become emotionally involved with your position and do not take other people&rsquo;s positions personally. Focus instead on meeting the survivor&rsquo;s needs together. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;You can do this by:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;- Opening the conversation by asking the other person to help you address the survivor&rsquo;s needs &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Look for a solution that will help the survivor now, rather than focusing on past events&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Address the problem &mdash; the survivor&rsquo;s needs &mdash; and never verbally attack the person with whom you are speaking&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Identify shared and conflicting interests&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Acknowledge and discuss the different perspectives and interests&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Prioritize interests, but always put the survivor&rsquo;s interests first&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;2. Generate a variety of options: It is useful to collaborate with the other person to generate multiple problem-solving options when negotiating, especially if these options make the different interests compatible or even complementary. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Try to avoid the following group obstacles:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;- Deciding on an option too early on&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Forgetting that the survivor is the priority &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Defining the problem in win-lose terms &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;* One of the parties may decide that is up to the other to come up with a solution &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;3. if things get difficult, define alternative approaches: Sometimes you will not be able to come to agreement, even after a long discussion. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Even if your negotiation is not successful, you can still accomplish your goal and generate other options by:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;- Defining other ways to achieve your goal and help the survivor&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- At the end of a negotiation, deciding together if you have fully achieved your goal&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Pointing out the benefits of your approach, if your alternative is better for the survivor than the option presented by the other person&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Taking a break and scheduling a follow-up, if necessary&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;4. Insist on using objective criteria: Agree with the other party about which criteria are legitimate and practical for the situation. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;To do so:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;- State your position on behalf of the survivor in an assertive and cooperative way, but try not to use an avoiding or forcing style&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Decide together how both parties will assess whether the solution will work for the survivor&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Check each other&rsquo;s perceptions of the &ldquo;fairness&rdquo; of the proposed solution&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Find a point on which you both can agree&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;5. Communicate effectively: Effective communication involves both talking and listening and is essential for an advocate to negotiate and collaborate effectively.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Try to:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;- See things from the other perspective&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Speak confidently&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Present yourself as self-assured and professional&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Avoid statements or words that may generate strong emotional reactions&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Listen attentively and without a defensive posture&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Clarify what is being said and paraphrase key points to ensure a common understanding&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;6. Build strong relationships: Create understanding, trust and respect when you communicate with healthcare providers. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;It can help to: &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;- Separate the person from the problem&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- If you have negative opinions about the person you are negotiating with, do not let those feelings interfere&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Remain open and respectful&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Differences can be positive, so do not view differences as reason to become defensive&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Recognize how the conflict is affecting the negotiation and try to find mutually agreeable points&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;7. Define commitments: At the end of negotiations, define what everyone will do to reach resolution by discussing next steps.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Then close the discussion by:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;- Making sure your commitments are realistic and clearly defined&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Paraphrasing and summarizing the agreements&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Making sure everyone leaves knowing who will do what&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Arranging for a way to confirm commitments&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;As an advocate, you may face conflicts you need to manage through skilled negotiation. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Effective negotiation is the result of knowledge and practice. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Even when negotiations are tense and uncomfortable, they can be viewed as opportunities to develop skills that can be used to benefit the survivor.&lt;/p&gt;",

For these reasons, it is important to get medical care as soon as possible. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Healthcare providers can offer:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- A physical exam to identify any injuries&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Emergency contraception to prevent pregnancy&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Medication to prevent HIV and other sexually-transmitted infections&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Testing to determine if the survivor was given a drug or sedating substance&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;As an advocate, you are there to emotionally support the survivor as the healthcare provider goes through the medical exam and the process of collecting evidence. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;They may be feeling nervous, scared, angry, sad, confused, embarrassed or numb. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;It can help to reassure the survivor that the sexual assault was not their fault. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If a survivor has decided to take this course of action, it is important they not eat, drink, smoke or use the toilet until evidence is collected. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If the survivor must use the toilet, a trained nurse can assist them.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;At all points during their visit to the health center, the survivor has a right to choose what care they want to receive. This is called &ldquo;informed consent.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;It is important that the survivor understand the forensic examination involves the collection and storage of evidence documenting, with photography, their injuries. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The exam can be done whether the survivor wants to involve the police or not. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;It is important for the exam to be completed at the health center because it is time sensitive. The more time that passes after the assault, the more likely it is that potential evidence could be lost. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;During the exam, it is important that the survivor understand that they can change their mind at any time and stop the process. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Just because they already signed forms or consented to the exam does not mean there is any pressure on them to have every process done during the exam. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;It is always their right to choose what parts they want completed and what parts they do not want completed.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;As an advocate, you may be asked to help the healthcare provider to go and get something they have forgotten, or to pass a message to a colleague. This is because once the evidence collection process has been started, the provider cannot leave the room without compromising the chain of evidence. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;You may be asked to speak with family members who are at the health center: do this only if the survivor signs a release form authorizing you to (see the &ldquo;Resources&rdquo; section).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If this is the case, observe confidentiality and only pass on the information that the survivor requested you to. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;For example, the survivor might ask you to go out to the waiting room to tell their partner or mother that they are okay, or to confirm that they are physically at the health center.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If the police arrive during the evidence collection process to speak with the survivor, you will need to ask them to wait until the process is completed.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;ol&gt;\r\n        &lt;li&gt;Forensic Exam Overview\r\n    &lt;p&gt;During the exam, the healthcare provider will examine at the survivor from head to toe, looking for any injuries or following on any complaints of swelling, bruising or anything else. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;With the survivor&rsquo;s consent, they will then photograph those injuries.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If the equipment is available, they will examine the survivor&rsquo;s body with a special light for dried fluids, which will be swabbed and packaged. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The survivor&rsquo;s mouth and fingernails will also be swabbed with cotton-tipped wads, and their fingernails will be clipped. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;At that point, if the survivor consents, they will lie down on the examining table and the healthcare provider will examine their genital area and, if consent is obtained, take photographs if needed. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The provider will take more swabs from different points on the survivor&rsquo;s genitals. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Once all the swabs have been collected, the evidence is packaged and, with the survivor&rsquo;s consent, released to law enforcement to keep custody of the evidence if and until the survivor decides to prosecute in court.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;After the exam, the survivor needs to receive medical treatment to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections, HIV and pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;For more information about advocating with law enforcement, please see section &ldquo;Connecting with Law Enforcement.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;ol&gt;\r\n        &lt;li&gt;Treatment Overview\r\n    &lt;p&gt;In addition to treatment for physical injuries and forensic evidence collection, the survivor needs to receive medical treatment for three key areas:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;1. Antibiotics to reduce the risk of sexually-transmitted infections&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;2. Antiretrovirals to reduce the risk of HIV transmission&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;3. Emergency contraception to reduce the risk of pregnancy&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;In addition, if the survivor suspects they may have been drugged, blood work will need to be done. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The sooner these laboratory tests are done, the better, as drugs can metabolize very quickly through the body.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Survivors may ask if they will be tested for sexually-transmitted infections as part of the forensic exam, but generally the answer is no. This is because it is too soon for these tests to show positive after exposure. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Bacterial sexually-transmitted infections can be prevented with antibiotics, which can be given by injection or pills.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;HIV transmission may not always be a concern, but if the healthcare provider determines that the survivor is at risk, they will prescribe a course of antiretrovirals to reduce the likelihood of infection.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Emergency contraception prevents a fertilized egg from implanting and will not harm an existing pregnancy. It is also very safe for breastfeeding women to take. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;It is important for a survivor to understand that emergency contraception does not prevent sexually-transmitted infections or HIV. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;It is necessary that the survivor follows the full course of treatment provided to them.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The healthcare provider will schedule a follow-up visit for testing for sexually-transmitted infections, HIV and pregnancy after some time has passed. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;It may be helpful for you to arrange to be present with the survivor for this visit to the health center as well.&lt;/p&gt;",

Inside the box there will be different envelopes, forms, bags and labels.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Just because parts of the kit may be labeled in order does not mean that they need to be completed in order. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If the survivor has been waiting to use the toilet, prioritize the internal exam so that they can use the toilet before the exam continues.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If the survivor is hungry or thirsty, prioritize the oral exam so that they can have something to eat or drink, and then continue the exam.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If all the sections are completed, it does not matter in which order they are done.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The healthcare provider needs to ask the survivor for permission before beginning each step of the physical evidence collection and exam, and wait to receive consent before they start. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;During the processes, they need to check in with the survivor to see if they should pause before continuing, especially if the survivor seems to be, or indicates that they are, in distress. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;You may need to ask the healthcare provider to pause or be patient, as supporting the survivor in this way takes additional time but is essential to providing appropriate emotional support. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;For someone who has already been through sexual assault, the steps of the collection process can feel forced and nonconsensual, like a repeat of the assault in many ways. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Navigate the process of consent at each step and do your best to support the survivor. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;There are several portions of external evidence collection. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;At each stage, pause with the healthcare provider, ask them to explain to the survivor what the next step will involve, and ask again for consent before you continue.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Everything in the forensic exam is optional. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The process of consent is the most important piece of your work as an advocate and must not be rushed or skipped. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If the survivor chooses not to consent to a step in this process, the fact that they did not consent will be written on the envelope to show that this is an intentional part of the process and not missed by mistake.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;ol&gt;\r\n        &lt;li&gt;Interview and Forms\r\n    &lt;p&gt;There are many forms that the healthcare provider needs to fill in to detail their information and the survivor&rsquo;s information, including the hospital name and the date and time of the exam. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The survivor will need to complete a consent and release form indicating that they understand and consent to what will be done in the exam, and they only need to consent to the parts they are comfortable with. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The survivor has every right to refuse parts of the exam that they are not comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;It is important for the healthcare provider to get as much detail as possible about what happened. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;For example, if the survivor waited hours or even days before coming to the health center, or if they showered before coming to the health center, this is important information to know as it will affect the evidence collected. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;When healthcare provider takes the survivor&rsquo;s history, this is to help the provider diagnose and treat the survivor and to direct the collection of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The consent and release forms ask the survivor detailed questions about their sexual history, general health, and drug and alcohol use to develop a picture of the event and what has happened. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;There are male and female diagrams, and the health provider will ask the survivor about injuries they have on their body and make marks on the diagram where there may be bruises, scratches and other injuries. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;All of this is to create a picture of what happened during the sexual assault for the prosecution if the case goes to trial, because months later these marks will no longer be visible.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;ol&gt;\r\n        &lt;li&gt;Photographs\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Photographic evidence would only be taken if the healthcare provider has the survivor&rsquo;s consent, both before the process and throughout. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Photographs document any injuries, including cuts and bruises, on the survivor&rsquo;s body. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;It is standard for two photographs to be taken of each injury. The first is a general photo of the injury and the second is with a ruler or other measuring device in the photo so that the size of the injury is clear. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;This is necessary because if the case goes to trial, these visible injuries will probably have disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Taking as much information as possible is vitally important for prosecution, but not every survivor has injuries that need to be photographed. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Just because a survivor may not have injuries or marks does not mean that sexual assault has not happened. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Documenting injuries is necessary to paint a picture of what happened at the time of the assault, and the forensic exam is the one opportunity to capture this. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;ol&gt;\r\n        &lt;li&gt;Clothing\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If the health center has a formal evidence collection kit, it will contain bags and envelopes to collect clothing from the survivor, including separate envelopes for undergarments. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Depending on the situation, the healthcare provider may ask them to remove some or all their clothing. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Like all parts of the exam, this is optional. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Whether the survivor decides to do this is their decision.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Because the survivor&rsquo;s clothing will become evidence, it is not likely that it will be returned to them. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;At this point, it can be helpful to have brought a spare set of clothes, including underwear, as the health center may not have any to provide (see the section, &ldquo;Getting Started: What to Bring to the Health Center&rdquo;). &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The healthcare provider will then spread a large sheet of paper beneath the survivor as they disrobe, so that any foreign materials found on their clothing, for example leaves or coat fibers, can be collected and labelled properly.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;For each section of evidence collection, materials need to be labelled clearly with the survivor&rsquo;s name, the date and the name of the healthcare provider who collected it.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;ol&gt;\r\n        &lt;li&gt;Taking Swabs\r\n    &lt;p&gt;This process can feel very invasive, so it is important to explain to the survivor what will happen and to receive consent before the healthcare provider proceeds. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If the right equipment is available, the provider will examine the survivor&rsquo;s body with a special light that shows any dried fluids. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If this light is not available, the provider can use cotton-tipped wads to swab any areas where the survivor reported that the perpetrator was in contact with them. These areas will be swabbed and labelled slides made and packaged (see &ldquo;Fixing the Slides&rdquo; below).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Then, the healthcare provider will take a buccal swab, several swabs of cotton-tipped wads from inside the survivor&rsquo;s mouth, to collect their own DNA. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;This involves the survivor taking a plastic stick and rubbing it up and down the inside of their cheek, inside their mouth, about ten times. This creates a DNA sample that can then be compared against other samples.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Next, the survivor&rsquo;s fingernails will be swabbed in the same way. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;They will also be clipped as, because debris, fiber or skin can be underneath the fingernails could be important. The survivor may prefer to clip their fingernails themselves, so that they determine the length that they are cut.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;ol&gt;\r\n        &lt;li&gt;Fixing the Slides\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If an evidence collection kit is available, it will include a larger number of cotton swabs to collect samples with, as well as many glass slides and a stand or other materials (like cups or stands) that help the slides air dry without touching any other surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;For each swab collected, the healthcare provider makes a slide that will need to air dry for a minimum of one hour before they are packaged up. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;This is to fix the sample so that it will not degrade over time or grow mold and become unusable.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Air drying is crucial to this process, so the slides must be clearly labelled and arranged so that they do not fall or touch each other over the one hour when they are drying. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;ol&gt;\r\n        &lt;li&gt;Pubic Hair Combings\r\n    &lt;p&gt;At this stage, the survivor will sit on a drape and use a small comb on the pubic area to pick up any debris, fiber, hairs or anything else that could be collected as evidence. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The healthcare provider may do this, or the survivor may prefer to do this step themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The whole drape is then folded and put into a labelled envelope. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If the survivor choses to skip this step, or if the survivor has no pubic hair, this will be written on the envelope. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;For future prosecution, the more detail that can be provided of the survivor&rsquo;s physical state and of the event, the better.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;ol&gt;\r\n        &lt;li&gt;Genital Swabs\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Swabs on the outside of the vagina or the outside of the penis area may pick up secretion samples or DNA evidence. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Slides must dry for a minimum of one hour to remain viable over time. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;It is likely and completely understandable that the survivor will become uncomfortable during this stage of the process.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;As an advocate, you can navigate the consent process, assure them that it will be okay and support them and help the process be as gentle as possible. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;ol&gt;\r\n        &lt;li&gt;Anal Swabs\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Swabs taken from the anus and around the rectal region may make survivors extremely uncomfortable. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;They may be very clear that nothing happened during the assault in this area and feel that their sexual practices are being questioned.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;It can help to share that because the body is curved and liquids run, taking samples from this area is a normal part of the process for all survivors. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;For this reason, the healthcare provider will take samples from a wide area. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;ol&gt;\r\n        &lt;li&gt;Internal Exam\r\n    &lt;p&gt;A physician will likely need to administer an internal exam to ensure there are no injuries. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;This is a very sensitive part of the process, and it is important to remember that the steps of an internal exam can feel, to the survivor, like a repeat of the sexual assault.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Do your best to work with the survivor and the healthcare provider to navigate the strong feelings that will likely come up. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Ensure that consent is given and maintained at each step of the process, and support the survivor using the communications skills you have learned.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;ol&gt;\r\n        &lt;li&gt;What Happens to the Evidence?\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If the equipment is available, the health center may be able to do the blood work themselves rather than sending the survivor&rsquo;s blood samples outside for testing.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;It is extremely important that all swabs are transferred to clearly labelled slides, which dry for at least one hour prior to packaging. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;In this way, the slides will remain viable as evidence over time.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The final step of the forensic exam is to package everything up in the kit and to use red stickers to close the box up as official evidence. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If there are materials, such as clothing, that do not fit into the box provided, use the same red stickers to create a seal around the bag that holds those materials. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The stickers indicate that the evidence has been sealed and at this point, the chain of evidence now passes to the healthcare center, who will have their own procedure for what happens next. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The stickers create what is called an &ldquo;integrity seal,&rdquo; which the healthcare provider will sign with their initials and the date of collection.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The health center may have secure storage for the kits, until the police come to claim the kit as evidence if a police report is filed.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;It is important for you to know and to communicate to the survivor how long the evidence will be stored at the health center, and how long the police will store it for, as this may play a part in determining when they decide to prosecute.&lt;/p&gt;",

                                                    "content": "&lt;p&gt;If you are working with healthcare providers who have not been trained in sexual assault evidence collection, they may still be willing to collect evidence in a medical exam.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The following are the standardized directions for evidence collection from sexual assault patients.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;While healthcare providers may need to reference these instructions on your device, it is best if they access this information on their own device, if possible. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;This will help to instill a sense of autonomy and self-directed learning on the part of the provider and help prevent you from crossing any sensitive boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;PLEASE ENSURE THAT YOU AND THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDER HAVE READ THE DIRECTIONS COMPLETELY PRIOR TO BEGINNING THE EXAM.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;IF YOU ARE RESPONDING TO CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE, READ SECTION &ldquo;RESPONDING TO CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE&rdquo; FIRST!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;IF PATIENT NEEDS TO URINATE AND DRUG FACILITATED RAPE IS SUSPECTED, READ SECTION &ldquo;PATIENT ASSESSMENT AND URINE COLLECTION.&rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;As this section is written for healthcare providers, you will notice a shift in tone and vocabulary. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;ol&gt;\r\n        &lt;li&gt;Pre-Exam Considerations\r\n    &lt;p&gt;1. Priority: should be given to examine the sexual assault patient. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Initially, triage the patient for medical needs, safety, and comfort before proceeding with the forensic exam. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Medical stability is the priority; the sexual assault exam is secondary to any necessary medical response. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Please note that medical stability is an on-going process during the sexual assault exam. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;2.&amp;nbsp;Advocate: Call your local advocacy program to provide the patient with a support person to be present during the forensic interview and exam. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The advocate&rsquo;s role is essential during this procedure. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The trained advocate can help with referrals, case management, long-term recovery and psychological healing of the patient. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If you are responding to a patient who came from a facility, do not use an employee of the facility as an advocate. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;3. Consent: After reading these instructions, explain the forensic examination to the patient and obtain consent for the following specific procedures allowing the patient to decide what procedures they will allow: &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Full (evidence collection and medical treatment) or limited (medical treatment) exam&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Documentation of injury, which may include photography and colposcope&lt;br&gt;- Pregnancy testing, STI Prophylaxis, and Emergency Contraception&lt;br&gt;- Urine collection for Drug-Facilitated Sexual Assault&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Release of evidence and/or reporting to law enforcement&lt;br&gt;- Referral to child safe house and/or appropriate pediatric medical agency for age appropriate patients&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The patient is under no obligation to report the assault to the police or to undergo the sexual assault exam. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Counsel the patient that collection of evidence is recommended even if they do not think that they want to press charges.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Ensure that the patient realizes that preservation of evidence is time sensitive and that now is the optimal time to collect. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;In the event the patient wants evidence collected, but at the time of the exam does not wish to have the case investigated by law enforcement, it is important to inform the patient how any collected evidence will be stored. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;It is often the case that for crime labs to accept evidence, an information report must be filed with the appropriate law enforcement agency responsible for transferring the evidence. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The information report will include, at minimum, the patient&rsquo;s name, date of birth, and most likely a reference to sexual assault. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Like all police reports, the information report is public record. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The patient is under no obligation to speak to law enforcement at the time of the exam or participate in an investigation. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The information report does not automatically result in an active investigation, but rather facilitates the transfer and storage of evidence. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If the patient decides to pursue an active investigation, they must contact the appropriate law enforcement agency to initiate the investigation. The advocate may be able to help the patient with initiating the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If the patient decides against evidence collection, a limited exam can be offered. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;A limited exam includes medications for STI prophylaxis and Emergency Contraception and you would not need a Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kit. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;With patient consent, pregnancy testing with subsequent emergency contraception and STD prophylaxis may be provided. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The patient still has the option to return within 5 days post assault for a full sexual assault evidence exam. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If the patient wants to file a police report, notify law enforcement. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The advocate should remain with the patient during the investigative interview with police. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;As part of the informed consent process, and before sample collection, survivors should be informed of:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;- The purpose of collecting samples for the kit by the medical examiner&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- How the kit may be used in the investigative process by the survivor&rsquo;s legal counsel or law enforcement&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Processes and associated time frames for testing kits by law enforcement&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Survivor notification of kit testing results (e.g. DNA) by law enforcement&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;4. Exam Payment &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Inform the patient if the evidence collection portion of the exam will be paid in full by the government, and which portions of treatment, if any, are covered. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If additional medical treatment charges are incurred, inform the patient that they may be held responsible for the medical portion of the charges (injury repair, prescriptions, etc).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If the patient may apply for additional funding to cover the medical treatment from a fund or commission, inform them that this is available if a police report is filed.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The advocate will likely have contact information for the fund or commission, if one exists in your area.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;5. Chain of Custody &mdash; READ! IMPORTANT!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Chain of custody refers to the examiner&rsquo;s ability to testify under oath that the evidence could not have been tampered or compromised in any way during its collection, packaging, storage or transfer. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Chain of Custody must be maintained at all times once the Sexual Assault Evidence Kit is opened. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;This means the examiner must stay with the evidence collected during the exam until all evidence has been properly sealed and secured. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Chain of Custody includes an Integrity Seal, which is the assurance that the examiner is responsible for collecting and packaging the evidence. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The Integrity Seal is the examiner&rsquo;s initials and the date of collection written over the taped seal of the Evidence Kit&rsquo;s small and large White Envelopes and large Brown Bag. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Once sealed, evidence should be signed over to law enforcement. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If this is not possible, evidence may be signed over to the next shift at your medical facility. The next individual must take full responsibility for the evidence until law enforcement is able to retrieve the Evidence Kit&rsquo;s White Envelope and Brown Bag. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Every individual who assumes responsibility for any evidence must document the handling and transfer of that evidence. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;It is acceptable to keep the kit in an area that is locked securely. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Ideally, law enforcement should obtain the completed kit as soon as possible following the exam. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;ol&gt;\r\n        &lt;li&gt;Sexual Assault History Form\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Obtain history of assault and relevant data as directed by the enclosed Sexual Assault History Form. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Complete as much information as possible on the History Form. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Print clearly and legibly. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;When asking the patient to give a description of the assault, DO NOT ASK LEADING QUESTIONS that lead to yes or no answers such as, &ldquo;Were you raped?&rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Instead, ask the patient &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Can you describe the incident to me?&rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Let the patient use their own words and use those words in your charting. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Documentation of the patient&rsquo;s account of the assault must be the patient&rsquo;s verbatim statement. Use quotations to indicate patient&rsquo;s actual statements. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;It is critical that no re-phrasing occur. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Let the patient know that for evidence collection you need to ask specific questions about which of the perpetrator&rsquo;s body parts touched the patient&rsquo;s body parts. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;This history is for diagnosis and treatment of the patient and to direct the collection of evidence. LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL DO THE INVESTIGATIVE INTERVIEW. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The examiner should avoid using the word &ldquo;rape&rdquo; in discussing any conclusions. Use the words &ldquo;sexual assault&rdquo; or &ldquo;assault.&rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;ol&gt;\r\n        &lt;li&gt;Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Exam\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If a Sexual Assault Evidence Kit is available at your health center, obtain one and make sure that it is fully intact.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If there is not a Sexual Assault Evidence Kit available, you may be able to create one with materials you have at the health center.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;See the section &ldquo;Sexual Assault Evidence Kit Materials&rdquo; for what you need to do this.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Read these Sexual Assault Instructions completely prior to starting the sexual assault exam. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Use Personal Protection Equipment (gloves) while collecting evidence to prevent cross-contamination and change gloves frequently during the sexual assault exam. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The patient&rsquo;s history is critical in directing the examiner&rsquo;s collection of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Specimens are collected from orifices or sites the patient indicates were involved in the sexual assault. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Exceptions would be pediatrics, drug-facilitated assault, patients with no memory or ability to verbalize the alleged assault, and/or if the examiner observes injuries or other findings. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;For these exceptions where the evidence is collected by the examiner but not reported by the patient, write on the outside of that envelope &ldquo;Collected Not Reported.&rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;ol&gt;\r\n        &lt;li&gt;Exam Room Preparation and Supplies\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Prepare the room by gathering equipment and supplies so that the exam may be conducted uninterrupted. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;This should include:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Speculum&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Sterile water&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Extra sets of gloves&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Blood drawing supplies&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Vital sign supplies&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Ruler for measuring injuries&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Permanent black marker&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- A stable stand for holding/air-drying the swabs&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Clothing for the patient to wear post exam&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Equipment specific for a sexual assault exam includes:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Colposcope&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Toluidine Blue Dye&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Alternative Light Source/Woods Lamp&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- A camera for photography&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;For a list of supplies in the Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kit, consult the section &ldquo;Materials&rdquo; in &ldquo;Creating Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kits.&rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If some supplies are not readily available in the health center, proceed with evidence collection using what you have. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Open the kit, lay out envelopes that you will use (based on the patient narrative), and label each envelope completely and legibly. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Label envelopes and bags before placing evidence inside. This minimizes the destruction of evidence and prevents the mix-up of evidence samples. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Complete the information on the front of the Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kit White Envelope and Brown Bag. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Once you have opened the Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kit, you must maintain Chain of Custody.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The examiner is responsible for the evidence. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The examiner must stay with the evidence collected during the exam until all evidence has been properly sealed and secured. Evidence is never to be left alone with the patient, family, friend, legal guardian, or advocate. (Refer to the section &ldquo;Chain of Custody.&rdquo;) &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Show the patient the room and supplies, and answer any additional patient questions. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Encourage the patient to have a person of their choice in the exam room to support them during the process. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;This may be the trained advocate or a friend/family member.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;ol&gt;\r\n        &lt;li&gt;Exam Steps\r\n    &lt;p&gt;These are the instructions for the Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kit. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;The items in a Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kit are in the section, &ldquo;Materials&rdquo; in &ldquo;Creating Sexual Assault Evidence Kits&rdquo; and can be pre-made for health centers by advocates or their organization.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;ol&gt;\r\n        &lt;li&gt;Responding to Child Sexual Abuse\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If the patient is under the age of eighteen years and there is a suspicion of child sexual abuse by a caregiver, family member or person in authority, your government&rsquo;s child protective services must be contacted. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Not reporting suspected child abuse and neglect, including sexual abuse, is a crime. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;When filing the report, inform the authorities if the alleged perpetrator has continued access to the child. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;A physician does not need the permission of a parent to collect evidence from a child who has been sexually abused. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Evidence in sexual crimes is considered &ldquo;fleeting&rdquo; and thus does not require a search warrant. The child is considered the &ldquo;crime scene.&rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;A parent or guardian can be charged with aiding and abetting an alleged perpetrator by not allowing the exam.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The primary differences in using this Sexual Assault Evidence Kit with cases of suspected Child Sexual Abuse are: &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- The window for evidence collection is up to 72 hours while for adolescents/adults, the window is up to 5 days. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- The examiner does not treat for sexually transmitted infections. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Sexually transmitted infections are evidence of the crime of sexual abuse. Cultures must be obtained prior to treatment with antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- The examiner does not need to take a Blood Standard for patients under 13 years of age. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Instead, the examiner should first take the appropriate Oral Swabs if oral penetration is suspected. Then, have the child rinse their mouth thoroughly. Clearly mark a Miscellaneous envelope with the patient&rsquo;s name and &ldquo;Buccal Standard.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Lastly, the examiner takes one swab to wipe the inside, fleshy part of the cheek. Use the entire surface of the cotton tip swab to maximize the amount of the child&rsquo;s buccal saliva obtained. Place the swab in a stable stand and let air-dry before placing it in the pre-labeled envelope.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- The examiner will not insert a speculum exam on a pre-pubescent child.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- The examiner should ask the child where secretions may have been left on their body and then swab those areas. The folds and creases in the child&rsquo;s vulvar area may be wiped with swabs to collect evidence if indicated.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Photographs are critical documentation of a child&rsquo;s injuries.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- In documenting the history in the History Form, the examiner must use the child&rsquo;s direct quotes rather than the examiner&rsquo;s interpretation of the child&rsquo;s statement. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;For more information, consult &ldquo;A National Protocol for Sexual Abuse Medical Forensic Examinations &mdash; Pediatric&rdquo; (April 2016) at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.justice.gov/ovw/file/846856/download&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;ust=1497686451298000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNEaX5kiRcXBWD3pnCIQxXLeL9771g&quot;&gt;https://www.justice.gov/ovw/file/846856/download&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;ol&gt;\r\n        &lt;li&gt;Clothing and Patient Disrobing\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The patient is under no obligation to forfeit their clothing for evidence. This is entirely the patient&rsquo;s decision. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Advise the patient that they may not receive clothing back and if it is returned, it will likely be damaged from lab tests. Explain to the patient that body fluids, hair, and/or trace fibers found on the clothing may contain critical information.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Even if the patient has changed clothing, it may be useful to collect the underwear worn to the exam, as the underwear may contain drainage from post-assault.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Inspect clothing for any tears, stains, and debris and document condition of clothing on the History Form. Be careful not to lose any trace fibers from the clothing. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Photographs of torn or bloodied clothing can support documentation. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Wet clothing may need to be temporarily laid out for drying and packaging. This must occur in a secured area. Document this in your charting.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Place two large sheets of paper on the floor, one on top of the other. The bottom sheet keeps the top sheet clean. The bottom sheet will be thrown away while the top sheet and any debris and/or trace fibers will be saved in the pre-labeled Floor Sheet bag.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Do not use plastic sheeting.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Have the patient remove their shoes prior to having them disrobe. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;While standing barefoot on the Floor Sheet, the patient can disrobe and drop clothes gently in the middle of the Floor Sheet. These will be the clothes collected for evidence. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If the patient declines submitting their clothes for evidence, have the patient lightly shake their clothes over the Floor Sheet for any potential trace fibers and lay the clothes aside. Allow patient to determine what pieces of clothing will be left for evidence.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Give the patient a hospital gown to wear during the subsequent exam.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The health center or the advocate should provide the patient with a set of clothing to wear home after discharge.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;ol&gt;\r\n        &lt;li&gt;Patient Assessment and Urine Collection\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Obtain the patient&rsquo;s vital signs. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If abnormal, recheck and take appropriate action. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Injuries causing pain or serious discomfort should be treated before starting the sexual assault exam. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If a drug-facilitated rape is suspected, urine needs to be collected and preserved. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Urine may be collected up to 96 hours post-assault. Have the patient urinate into a tamper-resistant, urine specimen container or cup that can be securely sealed. Label the container with the patient&rsquo;s information. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Obtain a urine specimen for pregnancy test on all female patients of childbearing age. If the specific gravity of the urine is &lt;1.015, a serum pregnancy test should be sent to the lab to assure accurate results. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Perform a head-to-toe assessment for evidence of trauma to the body and investigate any complaints of pain, working your way literally from &ldquo;head to toe.&rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Pay attention to any area of concern based on the mechanism of injury and the patient&rsquo;s history of assault.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Document all injuries. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Measure and describe all injuries indicating location of the injuries. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Use the Body Map that is part of the Sexual Assault History Form. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If possible, photographic documentation of injuries is strongly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;ol&gt;\r\n        &lt;li&gt;Blood Standard\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Draw a blood specimen, approximately 0.5ml, and transfer to pre-labeled card that is in the pre-labeled Blood Standard envelope. Blood stain should be about the size of a nickel or quarter coin. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Allow to air dry. Do not use heat to dry. Dry in a secure place to minimize cross-contamination. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Once dried, place this swatch into the pre-labeled Blood Standard envelope.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;ol&gt;\r\n        &lt;li&gt;Head Hair Standard\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Pull at least 25 head hairs and place them in the pre-labeled Head Hair Standard envelope. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Pull by hand near the patient&rsquo;s scalp. Include the root of the hair from different areas on the scalp, such as the front, middle, back, and both sides. Include grey hair. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Be sure to collect various lengths and color samples. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Hairs must be pulled. Scissors or tweezers damage the hair and the root is needed. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If head hairs adhere to the examiner&rsquo;s gloves, place the entire glove in the pre-labeled Head Hair Standard envelope.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;ol&gt;\r\n        &lt;li&gt;Oral Swabs\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Inspect the oral cavity first, documenting any injuries. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Photograph noted injuries. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If oral penetration is reported and/or suspected, swab the gum line, the margin between gums and cheek, the crevices between teeth, and under the tongue with the cotton swabs provided in the Oral Swabs envelope. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Do one swab at a time. Use the entire surface of each cotton-tip swab to maximize the amount of sample collected. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Mark the first swab obtained with a black marker on the distal wooden portion of the swab stick.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Place the swabs in a stable stand and let the 4 swabs air-dry. Once dried, place all 4 swabs back into the pre-labeled Oral Swabs envelope.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;ol&gt;\r\n        &lt;li&gt;Genital Exam\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Place the patient in an appropriate position of comfort, dependent on age, to optimally allow you to visualize and perform the vaginal/rectal/penile examination. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Inspect external genitalia and rectal area for visual signs of trauma. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Document injuries on the Genital Map of the History Form and photograph injuries before obtaining any swab collection. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If you are using a Colposcope, injury documentation should be done prior to obtaining any swabs.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;You will want to save the Table Sheet that the patient used on the exam table as evidence.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;ol&gt;\r\n        &lt;li&gt;Public Hair Combings \r\n    &lt;p&gt;The patient&rsquo;s pubic hair may contain dried secretions from drainage or ejaculation. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If the pubic hair is matted, representative samples should be cut and packaged separately in a pre-labeled Miscellaneous envelope. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Clearly mark on the Miscellaneous envelope what was collected and from where.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Comb the patient&rsquo;s pubic hair over the pre-labeled Pubic Hair Combings and Comb envelope so that the hair falls into the opened envelope. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;When complete, place comb back into envelope.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;You may ask the patient if they would prefer combing themselves. However, the examiner must observe the combing.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;ol&gt;\r\n        &lt;li&gt;Anal Swabs\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If rectal penetration is reported and/or suspected, examine the anal area first. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Examination and evidence collection of the anal area is performed prior to genital because this area can be contaminated when inspecting and collecting vaginal specimens. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Examine the rectal area for injury and document any noted injuries prior to obtaining swabs. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The use of a minimal amount of water-soluble, non-spermicidal lubricant, water or saline during the vaginal and/or rectal exam is acceptable and promotes patient comfort.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Remove any foreign bodies and let air-dry before placing in envelope marked Miscellaneous. Clearly document on the Miscellaneous envelope where the evidence was obtained from.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Obtain swabs of the rectal area with the cotton swabs provided in the envelope marked Anal Swabs. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Indicate on the Anal Swab envelope whether swabs are collected from outer anal folds or from within the orifice. If both situations exist, package in separate envelopes and clearly mark the envelope where evidence was collected.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Do one swab at a time. Use the entire surface of each cotton-tip swab to maximize the amount of sample collected. If particulate matter/fibers are on the swab, do not remove from the swab. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Mark the first swab obtained with a black marker on the distal wooden portion of the swab stick. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Place the 4 swabs in a stable stand and let the swabs air-dry. Once dried, place all 4 swabs back in the pre-labeled Anal Swabs envelope.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;ol&gt;\r\n        &lt;li&gt;Vaginal Swabs\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If vaginal penetration is reported and/or suspected, examine the vaginal area for injury.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Document injuries on the Genital Map of the History Form prior to inserting the speculum. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The use of a minimal amount of water-soluble, non-spermicidal lubricant, water or saline during the vaginal and/or rectal exam is acceptable and promotes patient comfort.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Insert speculum and inspect for injury or foreign bodies. Document any injury within the vaginal canal.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Colposcope documentation should be done prior to obtaining any swabs.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Remove any foreign bodies and let air-dry before placing in the envelope marked Miscellaneous.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Clearly document on the Miscellaneous envelope where the evidence was obtained from.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Obtain swabs of the vaginal area with the cotton swabs provided in the envelope marked Vaginal Swabs. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Indicate on the Vaginal Swab envelope whether swabs are collected from outer labial folds or from within the orifice. If both situations exist, package in separate envelopes and clearly mark the envelope where evidence was collected.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Do one swab at a time. Use the entire surface of each cotton-tip swab to maximize the amount of sample collected. If particulate matter/fibers are on the swab, do not remove from the swab. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Mark the first swab obtained with a black marker on the distal wooden portion of the swab stick.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Place the 4 swabs in a stable stand and let the swabs air-dry. Once dried, place all 4 swabs back into the pre-labeled Vaginal Swabs envelope.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;ol&gt;\r\n        &lt;li&gt;Cervical Swabs\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Examine the cervical area for injury.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Colposcope documentation should be done prior to obtaining any swabs.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Obtain swabs of the cervical os with the cotton swabs provided in the envelope marked Cervical Swabs.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Do one swab at a time. Use the entire surface of each cotton-tip swab to maximize the sample collected.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Mark the first swab obtained with a black marker on the distal wooden portion of the swab stick.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Place the 4 cervical swabs in a stable stand and let the swabs air-dry. Once dried, place all 4 swabs back into the pre-labeled Cervical Swabs envelope. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;ol&gt;\r\n        &lt;li&gt;Male Genitalia Swabs\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If the patient is male and, dependent upon patient history, collect penile, scrotum, and/or urethral swabs. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The examiner will swab the primary source of potential foreign DNA. This may include the penile shaft, glans, scrotum, and/or urethral opening.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Re-label the cervical and/or vaginal envelope to read &ldquo;Penile.&rdquo; Use the swabs that are in that envelope.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Do one swab at a time. Use the entire surface of each cotton-tip swab to maximize the sample collected.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Mark the first swab obtained with a black marker/Sharpie on the distal wooden portion of the swab stick.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Place the 4 penile swabs in a stable stand and let the swabs air-dry. Once dried, place all 4 swabs into pre-labeled Male Genitalia Swabs envelope. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;ol&gt;\r\n        &lt;li&gt;Miscellaneous Evidence\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If there is any other evidence such as blood, dried secretions, loose hairs, material fibers, environmental debris (vegetation, dirt, gravel, glass), and/or tampons, collect, dry, and place in a pre-labeled Miscellaneous envelope. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Clearly label the envelope to describe where evidence was collected.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If the patient reports scratching the suspect, swab under the patient&rsquo;s fingernails with swabs that have been moistened with sterile water. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Use one or two swabs per hand depending upon the amount of visible debris. Use the entire surface of each cotton-tip swab to maximize the amount of sample collected. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Place these swabs in a stable stand and let air-dry. Once dried, place swabs in a pre-labeled Miscellaneous envelope. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If swabs are collected from both hands, package swabs collected from left and right hand in separate pre-labeled envelopes, with clear indication of where evidence was collected.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;If the patient reports any contact of bodily fluid, use swabs moistened with sterile water to collect samples from the patient&rsquo;s body where contact was reported. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;This includes areas where the patient reports being bitten or licked. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Use one or two swabs per body part that patient reports contact. Use the entire surface of each cotton-tip swab to maximize the amount of sample collected. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;An Alternate Light Source or Woods Lamp may help visualize the body fluid. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Place these swabs in a stable stand and let air-dry. Once dried, place swabs in a pre-labeled Miscellaneous envelope, indicating where the evidence was collected.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;ol&gt;\r\n        &lt;li&gt;Other Evidence Collected: Film and/or Urine\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Do not put urine or film into the Sexual Assault Evidence Kit Envelope or Brown Bag.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Clearly mark urine and film with patient information and transfer it to law enforcement as separate items, along with the Sexual Assault Evidence Kit Envelope and Brown Bag.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Law enforcement is responsible for the processing of film.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Law enforcement is responsible for transferring the Sexual Assault Evidence Kit Envelope, Brown Bag, Film and/or Urine to their appropriate Crime Lab.&lt;/p&gt;",

A safety plan is a living thing that needs to change with time, so it is important that the survivor makes it their own and updates it as often as they need to.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Working with a survivor to develop a safety plan requires that you actively listen to the survivor, not only to obtain information, but to find out how the survivor thinks and feels about the situation. Take into account not just their physical safety, but their emotional and digital safety as well. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Address the survivor&rsquo;s needs from their own perspective, rather than from your own, and get as much input&amp;nbsp;from the survivor as possible. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;It is important for the survivor to find ways to be and feel safe, and safety plans should seek to reduce their risk, never increase it.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;A good safety plan identifies resources to address the survivor&rsquo;s needs, including decisions about what to do next and planning what to do in case there is a future incident. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Safety plans also connect the survivor with resources and allows them to make their own decisions and how and when to access them. Remember, advocacy is always about the survivor.&lt;/p&gt;",

Please use your discretion and best judgement.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;When you are safety planning with a survivor, you may know if they are living in a situation where there is intimate partner violence that could expose them to further or life-threatening risk.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;For this reason, it is important to screen for intimate partner violence and other forms of abuse. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Once you have done this, be prepared to share information about resources available in your community that could support the survivor and even help the survivor contact them, if they need you to. (See the section &ldquo;Building Referral Networks.&rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Ask the following questions to help the survivor develop their safety plan:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Where will they go after leaving the health center? Will anyone accompany them? If someone is accompanying them, will they be able to adequately support the survivor? Is there anyone else that the survivor would like to contact?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Does the survivor&rsquo;s living situation expose them to the threat of continued violence or harassment? Do they need emergency shelter or alternative housing options?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Is the survivor eligible for protective orders from law enforcement?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Does the survivor need additional security measures?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- What personal support systems are available, for example family members, friends, faith leaders or others who can provide emotional, financial or physical assistance to the survivor in the following days.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- If the survivor feels unsafe, what will they do to get help? Discuss the available options with them and help them to develop a plan.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Safety planning must also factor in the needs and concerns of specific populations. For example, if a survivor has physical disabilities, they may not be able to access the local domestic violence shelter or receive the staff support they need for their daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;",

This is true especially if you have concerns about how you handled your advocacy. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;It is common for advocates to avoid reaching out for support because they think that their supervisor or other colleagues who could support do not want to, when in fact they are eager to help their volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;If you are an advocate volunteering with an informal network of other advocates, consider creating a peer support group so that volunteers can debrief after particularly difficult cases. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Monthly peer support groups are opportunities for volunteers to talk about difficult cases and share best practices and lessons learned. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Both debriefing and sharing in peer support groups can be done while maintaining the survivor&rsquo;s privacy and confidentiality.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;When advocates share about their experiences they are less likely to experience stress-related conditions and move likely to remain engaged and committed to their work.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;ol&gt;\r\n        &lt;li&gt;Referrals",

                                    "content": "&lt;p&gt;For advocates to continue our important work in the long-term, self-care is essential. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;By creating a self-care plan, you identify activities and practices to engage in regularly to maintain your health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;The most effective self-care plan is personalized for your unique needs. It includes stress management, because although being an advocate is rewarding, it can be stressful at times. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Stress management techniques include:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;- Time management: If we often feel time pressure to get our work done, or we feel behind or overwhelmed by tasks and responsibilities, it is easy to feel stress. Over time, stress becomes chronic and negatively affects our mental, emotional and physical health. It is important to consider how we manage our time as an element of self-care.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;- Maintaining boundaries: Setting and maintaining healthy boundaries with survivors is essential. Overstepping these boundaries can lead to over-involvement with the survivor, which is unhealthy and unsustainable for your work as an advocate.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;- Eating right: Diet has a profound effect on our ability to tolerate and respond to stress. Good nutrition can increase your stamina and strengthen your immune system. Eating a variety of fresh, whole foods as close to their natural state as possible is ideal.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;- Rest and relaxation: Our physical, emotional and mental health require us to get enough sleep and time for relaxation. Often, when we feel time pressure, we often sacrifice this aspect of our self-care first, but it is extremely important.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;- Exercising: Movement allows our bodies to release built-up stress and strengthens our immune system. Exercise regularly by doing an activity that you enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;",

It is also considered the power to cope with adversity and adapt to challenges or change.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Learning to identify and implement self-care strategies can help you to be resilient as you react to stress.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Self-care builds resiliency, so we will explore how to create a self-care plan that you can use alongside your advocacy work.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Research has shown five core elements of resilience that we can develop as advocates:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;1. Personal Perspective and Meaning: Acknowledging the meaning that you attach to your work as an advocate and the challenges you face help keep you focused and self-aware. Maintaining your unique perspective and point of view as you navigate advocacy keeps you centered in your own experience and helps you avoid over-identifying with survivors.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;2. A Sense of Hope: A positive outlook and the belief that situations will improve are trademarks of an active hope that recognizes the challenges that survivors face while maintaining optimism in the face of these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;3. Healthy Coping: Being aware of the positive and negative aspects of your advocacy work helps you to see the impact that volunteering has on your emotional, mental and physical needs. With this awareness, you can proactively address negative feelings and develop positive and healthy coping mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;4. Strong Relationships: Positive relationships with others in our support network reduces the feeling of isolation that our work can sometimes have. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;5. Self-Knowledge and Insight: Having a clear sense of your feelings and beliefs allows you to be who you are, instead of who others may want you to be. Understanding your strengths and weaknesses allows you to build on where you are already successful and seek support for your own personal development.&lt;/p&gt;",

It is a form of energy depletion that relates specifically to overwork and often results in someone leaving their position because they are unable to provide support for others any longer.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Vicarious Trauma: Service providers may experience a long-term stress response because of the physical and emotional stress of working with traumatized individuals. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;By witnessing a survivor&rsquo;s pain and trauma, the advocate can unintentionally take on that stress themselves. Hearing certain patterns in stories repeatedly can also be stressful. Over time, this can become a type of trauma associated with symptoms of post-traumatic stress. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Compassion Fatigue: When service providers have poor self-care and feel the need to self-sacrifice for their work, their efforts to empathize and be compassionate can end up creating an extreme state of tension and preoccupation with the suffering of others. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Service providers who are first responders are especially vulnerable to compassion fatigue. Women and people who show more empathy are more at risk, so it is important to learn how to leverage the asset of empathy with a sense of detachment, to protect the volunteer from being consumed by someone else&rsquo;s story.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;ol&gt;\r\n        &lt;li&gt;Symptoms of Stress-Related Conditions\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Symptoms of stress-related conditions are important to address immediately, because if left untreated the can have a very serious effect on your life and your health.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;It is important to be aware of these symptoms in yourself and others, so that you can create a supportive culture that encourages volunteers to reach out for help and support when they need it.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;If you are experiencing any of these symptoms because of your work, your ability to be a strong advocate for survivors is compromised. Please take care of yourself first, and you can return to the work when you are able.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;It is important to think about and plan for how you will handle your feelings when you are in the role of advocating for a survivor. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Whether we mean to or not, we carry residual stress from our interactions with survivors with us. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;These can trigger traumatic memories, cause nightmares or cause us to think back negatively about the person. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;It is also common for advocates to become preoccupied with issues related to sexual assault and intimate partner violence. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;There is a difference between educating yourself about the topic and becoming overly preoccupied with it. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Maybe you feel disoriented and notice that it is hard for you to focus in your life, or you become overly focused on or concerned about a survivor, wondering if you did a good enough job as an advocate.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Maybe you start to feel survivor&rsquo;s guilt that none of the things that happened to the people you advocate for have happened to you, or you feel angry and hopeless at how dark and dangerous you feel the world is.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Maybe you become hyper-vigilant because of a fear of being sexually assaulted, lose your appetite or start to nub yourself with overeating, your sleep patterns change, or you start to experience strange pains in your body.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;These can all be emotional symptoms of stress-related conditions that are important to identify so that you can do something about them before they become serious.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;If you are working in a network of volunteers or with an organization, it is essential not to take on too much work. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;The more cases we take on, the more likely it is that we carry those stories with us and become angry or exhausted. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;It is important that volunteering be a positive experience for advocates and only by addressing the challenges transparently and vulnerably can we create that.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Here are some physical, behavioral and psychological symptoms of stress-related conditions:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Physical&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;- Exhaustion, feeling physically drained&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Insomnia&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Nightmares &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Headaches, gastrointestinal problems&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Increased susceptibility to illness&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Somatization, or translating emotional stress into physical symptoms&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Hypochondria, or anxiety about real or imagined physical ailments&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Behavioral&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;- Increased use of alcohol or drugs&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Missing work or other activities&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Inability to make decisions&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Problems in personal relationships&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Compromised care for survivors&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Overeating or under-eating&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Difficulty maintaining professional boundaries with the survivor &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Psychological&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;- Isolation or distancing from family and friends, numbness&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Negative self-image&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Depression, anger, or irritability&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Reduced ability to feel sympathy and empathy&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Cynicism (a sign of compassion fatigue and vicarious trauma)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Resentment&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Dread of working with certain survivors&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;- Feeling of professional helplessness&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;ol&gt;\r\n        &lt;li&gt;Risk Factors for Stress-Related Conditions\r\n    &lt;p&gt;All of us are vulnerable to burnout, vicarious trauma and compassion fatigue, but certain risk factors make some of us more vulnerable than others. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;By understanding our personal risk factors, it is easier to identify how to cope with stress more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Here are some risk factors for stress-related conditions that advocates face:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;- Past Victimization: If you are a survivor of sexual abuse, sexual assault, intimate partner violence or other trauma, unresolved issues could cloud your perspective as an advocate. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;For example, you might over-identify with a survivor or take an overly protective role, attempting to rescue them or make decisions for them. You also might relive your own victimization. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Although these same experiences can be the ones that drive us to work for the rights of survivors and give us greater empathy for them, we need to be aware of how our personal story can intrude on our advocacy. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;It is important to have a professional counselor to talk these issues through with as they come up.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;- Personal Life and Characteristics: If you already have a high level of stress in other areas of your life, the stress of advocating for survivors of sexual assault and intimate partner violence may put a larger strain on you than others. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Getting social support for yourself is essential. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Belong to or create a network of trusted colleagues or friends with whom you can share about the stress of what you are doing without jeopardizing privacy or confidentiality. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Manage advocacy boundaries, maintain realistic expectations of yourself and others, and be sure to leave lots of time in your life for resting and relaxing on your own and with family and friends. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;- Work Environment: The nature of advocacy is stressful. We hear horrible and graphic stories and frequently do not have closure or an opportunity to know how things worked out for the survivor in the long term. &nbsp;We may also feel overwhelmed with a sense of responsibility for survivors. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Getting the support of other advocates is critical. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;If you are volunteering in a peer network or other organization, deliberately co-create a culture of support and be sure advocates are giving themselves adequate time off.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;- Context: It is natural for sexual assault and intimate partner violence survivors to feel insecure and have trouble trusting or accepting. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;They may react to advocates with mistrust, a sense of distance and a lack of gratitude that can be confusing to advocates. You may feel annoyed, angry, unappreciated or manipulated. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;You also might find it stressful to interact with survivors from different cultures who don&rsquo;t act the way you expect, who fear the police and judicial system, and who may reject your assistance. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;This can be frustrating and stressful, especially over time.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        ",
